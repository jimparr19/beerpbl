# beerpbl

**beerpbl** is a web application for learning individual preferences for beer through pairwise comparisons.

This has been developed using data collected through the beer52 website and Ferment magazine.
 
This is based on the [pypbl](https://github.com/jimparr19/pypbl) library to infer individual preferences.
